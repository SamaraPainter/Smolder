There's Been A Murder (TBAM) is a single player virtual reality experience, designed on an Oculus Rift 
and using the touch controllers, which are bundled with all newer editions of the Rift.

To run the game, extract the zipped build and open the .exe application.

Controls:

Right Hand (RH) Trigger: Point your right hand at UI elements until you see a small blue circle. 
	This is a reticule.Once you see this reticule, pull the trigger to interact with UI elements.

RH Analog Stick: Push  forward on the right hand analog stick to begin teleportation. A line will be
	projected from your right hand. If pointed at a valid target on the floor, this line will turn
	green. If pointed at an invalid target, this line will be red. To complete teleportation to the
	targeted area, release the stick. To cancel, press the stick inward towards the controller
	until you feel a click. While teleporting, moving the stick left or right will change the 
	direction you will be facing at the end of the teleport. This direction is represented by an
	arrow in the teleporter object.

	When not teleporting, press the right analog stick left or right to rotate 90 degrees.

RH Y Button: The Y button is the top button on your right hand. Pressing this button will activate the
	player tablet, which will keep track of important information.

Interacting with the world: Both of your hands have presense in VR. You can move them around freely to reach
	for, touch, press, and grab objects. To grab, press down the grip (button on the inside of each
	controller, usually under the middle finger) and trigger buttons to create a fist. Forming a fist
	over any "grabbable" object will allow you to move it around in space.

	Some objects within the game will require time and thought to learn their functions, use, and
	means of access. This is part of our experience. If you get stuck, some of the guests may provide
	helpful clues to point you in the right direction.

Conversing with the guests: Converse with the guests by approaching them. A button prompt will appear if they
	can be interacted with. Follow that prompt, and use trigger to interact with the conversation UI.


Making your accusation: Once you have collected enough relevant evidence, you can choose to accuse a guest 
	during conversation with them. This triggers the end of the game. 






There's Been A Murder was created on June 3rd, 2019. The result of over 9 months of preparation, labor,
teamwork, and passion. It was created by a core team of 8 Drexel students, lead by Erin Truesdell and Sydney
Oswald, but several others came to our aid to provide their unique talents towards the project. 
Development was documented at PredictionError.com, and more information on the game can be accessed there.

We hope you enjoy.
